# Yeti Tool FTP Client

A new way to upload your project files straight to your SmartBench!

## Installation

To download an up to date Windows installer, visit our website [here](https://www.yetitool.com/support/downloads).

Once downloaded, run the "Installer.exe" file and the installer will navigate you through the process. When the installer is done, it will automatically open and begin scanning for your SmartBench!

We currently do not support any operating system other than Windows.

You may also compile the program yourself by downloading the project files, opening the solution and building in Visual Studio.

## Usage

Before using this software, please ensure you are on the latest version of easycut.

Please ensure your computer and your SmartBench are both connected to the same device before attempting to scan for your SmartBench. Once you have ensured this, open the client and once it has finished scanning you should see your SmartBench(es) listed as the name set in the SmartBench settings. Click the icon for the SmartBench you want to transfer files to and it will open a new window, where you can drag and drop your files.

After drag and dropping your file(s) to the file transfer area, you should see a tick within a few seconds (depending on file size) to confirm your transfer was complete.

If you receieve a message that your file failed to transfer, ensure you are on the latest version of Easycut and check your connection on both your computer and the SmartBench. If this issue persists, please submit a support ticket [here](https://www.yetitool.com/support/submit-a-ticket).

When you're done transferring files, simply close all windows of the program and now you're all set to start using your project files on the SmartBench.
